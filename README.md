# dicee
As part of the bootcamp training, I developed a virtual dice game using CSS, HTML and JavaScript including the Document Object Model (DOM). The game allows players to roll dice and determine the winner.
Bellow are some use cases for the code, including:
Online board games: Gameplay can be enhanced by integrating the code into board games, adding realistic dice rolls using CSS and dynamic updates using JavaScript.
Decision-making apps: Applications requiring chance-based decision-making, such as virtual casinos or interactive storytelling.
